Project Title :- SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS
Description :- This project aims to analyze social media data to gain insights into various trends, sentiments.Leveraging advanced data analytics, we will explore patterns in user interactions, identify key influencers, detect emerging topics, and assess sentiment dynamics.
This project entails the following components:
1.Data Acquisition: Identify suitable data sources such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or other platforms. Utilize APIs or web scraping techniques to gather relevant data, including posts, comments, likes, shares, user profiles, and metadata.
2.Data Preparation: Cleanse and preprocess the acquired data to ensure consistency and reliability. This involves tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and filtering out irrelevant information.
3.Database Design: Design an efficient database schema to store the structured social media data. Consideration should be given to tables for users, posts, comments, likes, shares, hashtags, and any other pertinent entities. Normalization techniques may be applied to optimize database performance.
4.SQL Queries: Develop a set of SQL queries to perform various analyses on the social media data. These queries may include:
•Basic analytics such as counting the number of posts, comments, likes, and shares.
•Trend analysis to identify popular topics or hashtags over time.
•Sentiment analysis to assess the overall sentiment of posts or comments.
•User engagement metrics such as average likes per post, top influencers, or user activity patterns.
•Network analysis to identify connections between users or communities within the social network.
5.Visualization: Visualize the results of SQL queries using appropriate tools such as charts, graphs, or dashboards. Visualization techniques can enhance the understanding of trends, patterns, and insights derived from the social media data.
6.Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation detailing the project objectives, data sources, database schema, SQL queries, analysis methodologies, and visualization techniques employed. Clear documentation facilitates understanding and replication of the project by others.
